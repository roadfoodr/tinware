Create a Python and Pandas script that does the following:

1. Read a file named "NWL23.txt" containing a list of valid words, one per line.

2. Extract all 2-letter words from this list.

3. For each 2-letter word, generate 3-letter words by:
   a) Adding each letter of the alphabet [a-z] before the 2-letter word
   b) Adding each letter of the alphabet [a-z] after the 2-letter word

4. Filter the generated 3-letter words to keep only those that exist in the original word list.

5. Ensure that each 2-letter word has at least one "before" and one "after" entry:
   a) If no valid 3-letter words are formed by adding a letter before, include a placeholder row with "-" as the added letter (answer) and "-" as the answerWord
   b) If no valid 3-letter words are formed by adding a letter after, include a placeholder row with "-" as the added letter (answer) and "-" as the answerWord

6. For each valid 3-letter word (and placeholder entries), check if adding 's' at the end creates a valid 4-letter word (present in the original word list).

7. Create a pandas DataFrame with the following columns:
   - taskID: A unique identifier for each row, formatted as "task_" followed by a number
   - topic: Always "3-Letter Words"
   - gametype: Always "AddOne"
   - subtopic: "before" if the letter was added before, "after" if added after
   - root: The original 2-letter word
   - answer: The letter that was added (or '-' for placeholder entries)
   - answerWord: The resulting 3-letter word (or '-' for placeholder entries)
   - hint: An empty string
   - definition: Always "pending"
   - canAddS: "true" if adding 's' creates a valid 4-letter word, "false" otherwise (always "false" for placeholder entries)

8. Save this DataFrame to a CSV file named "valid_three_letter_words_formatted.csv" without including the index.

9. Print some statistics:
   - Total number of entries (including placeholders)
   - Total number of valid 4-letter words that can be formed by adding 's'
   - Number of entries with letter added before
   - Number of entries with letter added after
   - Number of placeholder entries

10. As an example, display all rows for a specific 2-letter word (e.g., "be").

11. Display all rows with placeholders (where answerWord is "-").

Use pandas for data manipulation and try to optimize for efficiency where possible. Ensure the script is well-commented and follows Python best practices.
