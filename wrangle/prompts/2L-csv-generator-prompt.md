Create a Python and Pandas script that does the following:

1. Read a file named "NWL23.txt" containing a list of valid words, one per line.

2. Generate all possible 2-letter words by:
   a) Adding each letter of the alphabet [a-z] before each letter of the alphabet [a-z]
   b) Adding each letter of the alphabet [a-z] after each letter of the alphabet [a-z]

3. Filter these generated 2-letter rows to keep only those that exist in the word list from NWL23.txt.

4. For each valid 2-letter word, check if adding 's' at the end creates a valid 3-letter word (present in the original word list).

5. Add special cases for the letters 'c' and 'v':
   a) Add four rows: two for 'c' (before and after) and two for 'v' (before and after)
   b) For these special cases, set the 'answerWord' and 'answer' fields to '-'
   c) Set 'canAddS' to 'false' for these special cases

6. Create a pandas DataFrame with the following columns:
   - taskID: A unique identifier for each row, formatted as "task_" followed by a number
   - topic: Always "2-Letter Words"
   - gametype: Always "AddOne"
   - subtopic: "before" if the letter was added before, "after" if added after
   - root: The original single letter
   - answer: The letter that was added (or '-' for special cases)
   - answerWord: The resulting 2-letter word (or '-' for special cases)
   - hint: An empty string
   - definition: Always "pending"
   - canAddS: "true" if adding 's' creates a valid 3-letter word, "false" otherwise

7. Save this DataFrame to a CSV file named "valid_two_letter_words_formatted.csv" without including the index.

8. Print some statistics:
   - Total number of valid 2-letter words generated (including special cases)
   - Total number of valid 3-letter words that can be formed by adding 's'
   - Number of valid 2-letter words formed by adding a letter before
   - Number of valid 2-letter words formed by adding a letter after

9. As an example, display all rows for a specific root letter (e.g., "a").

10. Display the rows for the special cases 'c' and 'v'.

Use pandas for data manipulation and try to optimize for efficiency where possible. Ensure the script is well-commented and follows Python best practices.
